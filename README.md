# Python-Projects
All of my Python projects were coded in Visual Studio Code — documenting my first year of learning Python’s syntax, behaviors, and algorithms.A journey into clean code and creative problem-solving.

Mainly looking to utilize thought processes and techniques that allow more understanding of machine learning, data science, and software engineering.
